# Millennial Energy Challenge Winning Project 🏆

## Project Overview 🌍
Our team, comprising Ali Yusifov, Elnur Shahbalayev, and Zaid Ashraf, clinched first place in the "Millennial Energy Challenge." This competition focused on harnessing data to drive energy efficiency and sustainability. Our project utilized data from Uber and other sources to develop models and visualizations that shed light on urban transportation energy dynamics.

## Challenge Objective 🎯
The objective was to leverage data science and machine learning techniques to analyze energy usage patterns, specifically in the context of urban mobility. By processing and interpreting data from Uber and optimising the route of goods delivery, we aimed to propose solutions for more energy-efficient urban transportation systems .

## Data Sources 📊
- **Uber Data**: Provided a rich dataset for analyzing urban transportation patterns.
- **`london.json`**: Geospatial data used for mapping and spatial analysis.
- **`training_WeeklyAggregate.xlsx`**: Weekly aggregate data for training our models.

## Notebooks Description 📓
- **`MEC_Intro_2.0.ipynb`**: Offers a detailed overview of the competition, including guidelines and objectives.
- **`Team ChemCoders_291021.ipynb`**: Contains our team's comprehensive analysis and model building efforts. It showcases our approach to data processing, analysis, and the development of predictive models.

## Key Features of Our Project 🌟
- **Innovative Data Analysis**: Cutting-edge techniques to dissect and understand complex transportation data.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed models to forecast mean travel time.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Utilized data visualization tools to represent our findings clearly and engagingly.

## Technologies Used 💻
- Python and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization.
- Libraries and Technologies such as Gooogle Map API, GeoPandas, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Json, Math, Requests and Scikit-Learn.
